Write an application that starts two thread. First thread displays 
even numbers in the range specified from the command line and 
second thread displays odd numbers in the same range. Each 
thread waits for 300 milliseconds before displaying the next 
numbers. The application waits for both the thread to finish and 
then displays the message “Both threads completed”.
